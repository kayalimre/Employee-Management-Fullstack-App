> It is project documentation, not architect memory — read it as input, never overwrite it.

## Sequential thinking
The bundled `sequentialthinking` reasoning tool (`factory-sequentialthinking` MCP) is **off by default**. Set `Status` to `enabled` to let the architect use it — and even then only when a review or decision is genuinely complex enough to benefit (routine reviews never trigger it). Any value other than `enabled`, or a missing section, reads as disabled.
