## Canonical Schema

The structural plan schema is the single source of truth at:
**`claude-plugin/references/plan-schema.md`**

The `/factory:plan` skill reads that file (main thread) and injects its contents into the
planner subagent's prompt. The planner follows the injected schema exactly. This file holds
**conventions only** — no schema copy here.

## Planning Conventions
- Hierarchy: epics → stories → tasks (no spikes for now)
- Estimation units: TBD — no estimation scheme is in use in this repo.
- Definition of Done: TBD. Observed de facto gates: backend `mvn test` and frontend `npm test` green (both enforced by `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), Prettier formatting clean, and the root `openapi.yaml` updated when the REST surface changes.
- Labels / components: TBD. Natural component split for this codebase — `backend`, `frontend`, `infra` (docker/k8s/terraform), `db` (`databases/`, migrations/seed).
- PMO is GitHub Issues on `kayalimre/Employee-Management-Fullstack-App` (see `.factory/config.json`); base branch is `master`.
- The repo is a two-app fullstack system: a feature usually spans a backend slice (controller/service/repository/DTO + `openapi.yaml`) and a frontend slice (`src/services/*` + component). Slice vertically by capability rather than by app wherever the granularity floor allows.
- `packages/` is a stale duplicate of the backend source with no build file — never plan work into it.

## Slicing Granularity
- How finely the planner slices is governed by the canonical rubric at
  **`claude-plugin/references/granularity-rubric.md`**, injected into the planner's prompt by
  `/factory:plan` (prefixed with an `ACTIVE CONFIGURATION` block). Not embedded here — pointer only.
  Every closed set and bound: `node claude-plugin/servers/lib/granularity.mjs --schema`.
- **The floor is semantic (`scope`), the ceiling is quantitative (files/tokens/layers, derived from
  the executor's context window).** Acceptance criteria are coverage and never size a task.
- Project settings live in `.factory/config.json` → `planning` (see below), not here.
- Per-run override: `/factory:plan <requirement> --granularity <capability|layer|artifact>` (alias
  `-g`), plus `--scope` / `--axis` / `--max-files` / `--objective`.
- Project default: **`capability`** (`planning.granularity.preset` in `.factory/config.json`), objective `balanced`.
- Split policy (from `.factory/config.json` → `planning.granularity.split`):
  - `migration: shared` — DB schema/seed changes (`databases/sql/`, `data.sql`, entity `ddl-auto` effects) are a shared task, not duplicated per consumer.
  - `tests: folded` — test work folds into the implementing task (no standalone test tasks).
  - `contracts: shared` — the root `openapi.yaml` contract update is one shared task feeding both the backend and frontend slices.
  - `screen_states: folded` — a screen's loading/empty/error states fold into the screen's task.
  - `endpoints: per-family` — endpoints group per resource family (e.g. all `/api/employees` operations together, all `/api/departments` together, passkey ceremony endpoints together).

## Concurrency Conventions
- Every plan the planner produces must include a **parallelism analysis**: wave schedule (tasks
  per parallel frontier), critical path (longest FS chain, hop-count proxy), and max concurrency
  width — in both `PLAN-*.md` (human-readable `## Parallelism analysis` section) and the
  `parallelism` block in `PLAN-*.json`.
- The wave shape is an **output of the real dependency graph**, never a target the graph is bent
  to hit. Pick the loosest-correct dependency type; never fabricate, drop, or retype a real edge;
  never over-fragment a coherent task to inflate parallelism.
- Concurrency is maximized **within the granularity floor** — never slice below the active scope's
  floor to widen a wave. At `capability` scope, an honest `max_concurrency_width: 1` is a correct
  plan. Cutting vertically usually buys fewer tasks *and* more parallelism, since vertical slices are
  independent while layer slices chain.
- Project-specific edge reality: the shared `openapi.yaml` contract task and any shared DB migration
  task are common upstream nodes; backend and frontend capability slices below them are typically
  genuinely independent.
- The analysis block shape is defined in `claude-plugin/references/plan-schema.md`.

## Sequential thinking
The bundled `sequentialthinking` reasoning tool (`factory-sequentialthinking` MCP) is **off by default**. Set `Status` to `enabled` to let the planner use it — and even then only when a requirement is genuinely tangled enough to benefit (routine slicing never triggers it). Any value other than `enabled`, or a missing section, reads as disabled.

Status: disabled
